  title: OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance
  description: |
    Provides a port for the draft 7 JSON Schemas provided by the [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance framework](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html) for use in OpenAPI 3.0.x (given the current lack of 3.1.0 support in most editors and tooling - unless you use Stoplight of course).

    Couple of notes on the approach:

    * The [source request](https://openid.net/schemas/verified_claims_request-12.json) and [response schema](https://openid.net/schemas/verified_claims-12.json) implement the `type: null` approach. This has been swapped out for `nullable: true` and the `oneOf` parent removed.

    * In the source schema `if`, `then` and `else` keywords are used to provide polymorphism in the `evidence` Schema object. This has been swapped for using `oneOf` and would ideally be complemented with a `discriminator` property. However, unfortunately the property is nested and cannot be referenced in the parent correctly. The same effect is therefore produced creating several copies of the `enum` that drives selection, implementing it with one value and then "merging" that with the correct properties using `allOf`.

    * As this is a Userinfo endpoint the response is returned as an ID Token. The semantics of a JSON Web Token/Signature/Encryption are not well supported by OpenAPI so only the claims are modeled here.

    * The design inherits the snake case convention of the source schemas.

    * Some objects have been suffixed "_request" and "_response" where names clash between schemas (not an issue if they were referenced remotely of course), but where possible the names of the majority have been preserved. Not done perfectly/systematically, but just enough to get all validation errors to disappear.

    * The specification does not define non-2xx responses as this is not explicitly specified in the source standards.

    * A Security Definition object `authorizationCode` is included but obviously the inclusion of scope-driven claim verification is at the OpenID Providers behest. The list of scopes is likely to be based on the available claims at the OpenID Provider and therefore should be modified by the implementer to match what's on offer.

    When 3.1.0 is widely support the contents of `'#/components/schemas'` backport can be scrapped and referenced remotely. Some refactoring of the naming may be required, but that's likely to be largely hidden within the remote references.
