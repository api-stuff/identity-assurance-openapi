# OpenAPI for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0

This repository provides an [OpenAPI document](specs/identity-assurance-userinfo-openapi.yaml) to represent a Userinfo endpoint that offers verified identity claims inline with the [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance framework](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html).

The purpose of the framework is to verify and retrieve claims that are attested by the OpenID Provider to have been verified by a given trust framework. If you want to know more please read the specification itself as repetition here is an exercise in superfluity.

If you want to see the document rendered please see [this link](https://api-stuff.github.io/identity-assurance-openapi/).
